Summary
This activity involved analyzing a group of data based on their business model and making use of forecasting tools using graphs and tables. For this project, I used Google Colab which made use of python to fasttrack the process in deriving key information for the project. Examples of the key projects are finding the total sales by region or by categories, etc. We has to do the exercise both using Google Colab and Excel. The main purpose of this project was to compare and find the difference between using wither google colab and Excel.

Insights
Among all the categories that were sold, technology carries most of the sales
Central region has the least profit as compared to West having them most
Ther performance is high but the profits are not too great

Python VS Excel
In this case, using python is way more efficient. The main difference is the amount of time required to get the work done. It took me almost an hour to finish the project using Microsoft Excel however, on Google Colab through the help of Python, this activity was done in a few minutes.
